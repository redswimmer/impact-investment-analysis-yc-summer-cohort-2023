# impact-investment-analysis-yc-summer-cohort-2023
I decided to experiment with the dataset provided in the article by Brandon Lopez, titled [Impact Investment Preliminary Analysis of Y Combinator Summer Cohort 2023](https://www.valleyinnovators.com/post/impact-investment-preliminary-analysis-of-y-combinator-summer-cohort-2023). In this study, Brandon scrutinizes 25 of the startups accepted into Y-Combinator, assigning them a Valley Innovators Impact Index (VIII). The VIII is a weighted formula used to evaluate the potential of a startup for impact investors, and it is calculated as VIII = societal impact x societal reach x time to impact. I wanted to explore how accurately I could reverse-engineer the formula by using a linear regression model trained on the features mentioned in the article. For a playful twist, I also added a few new elements (up votes and hashtags) from the startups' bio pages on the YC site.
